## **1\. Game Title**

**CubeHarvest: Cluster Frontier**

## **2\. Logline**

A resource management simulation where players strategically deploy and scale "Astro-Units" across vibrant "Astro-Nodes" to mine valuable cosmic resources, build a resilient "Galactic Grid," and outmaneuver chaotic space events to dominate the intergalactic market.

## **3\. Concept Overview**

"CubeHarvest: Cluster Frontier" reimagines a distributed computing system as a living, breathing interstellar mining operation. Players take on the role of a "Galactic Grid Administrator," tasked with orchestrating a fleet of automated "Astro-Units" across various celestial "Astro-Nodes" â€“ each a unique biome rich in specific resources. The core gameplay revolves around declarative management: players define *what* they want their grid to achieve (e.g., "mine this resource," "process that data"), and the underlying systems automatically handle the how, including self-healing from "Astro-Node failures" and "Astro-Unit crashes." The goal is to accumulate wealth by selling processed resources, expand the grid by acquiring new Astro-Nodes, and unlock advanced "Grid Technologies" to improve efficiency, resilience, and output.

## **4\. Genre**

* Resource Management Simulation  
* Base Building / Tycoon  
* Idle/Incremental (with active strategic management)

## **5\. Theme & Setting**

The game is set in a stylized, low-poly, and vibrant cosmic frontier. Each "Astro-Node" is a distinct, miniature celestial body or asteroid, visually representing its unique resource type and environmental challenges. "Astro-Units" are depicted as small, customizable worker drones. The overall aesthetic is clean, functional, and slightly abstract, visually breaking the boundary between complex technical concepts and an engaging game world.

## **6\. Core Gameplay Loop**

The game's loop is cyclical and ever-expanding:

1. **Observe Galactic Grid:** Monitor Astro-Node health, Astro-Unit performance, resource levels, and market prices via a central "Galactic Grid Overview." Initially, this provides high-level data; deeper insights require deploying "Telemetry Units."  
2. **Plan & Deploy:** Define "Directives" for specific "Astro-Unit Images" (e.g., Miner, Processor) to target Astro-Nodes, specifying the desired number of "Replicas."  
3. **Resource Extraction & Processing:** Deployed Astro-Units automatically extract raw resources. "Processor Units" convert raw resources into higher-value refined goods.  
4. **Collection & Transport:** Resources are automatically transported from Astro-Nodes to the central "Central Repository" (formerly Master Node Storage).  
5. **Market & Trade:** Sell accumulated resources for "Credits" (in-game currency) at a dynamically fluctuating market.  
6. **Reinvest & Expand:** Use Credits to:  
   * Deploy more Astro-Units to boost production.  
   * Purchase and provision new "Astro-Nodes" with unique resources or challenges.  
   * Research and unlock advanced "Grid Technologies" (e.g., Adaptive Scaling Protocol, new Astro-Unit Images, resilience upgrades, Interlink Network components).  
   * Upgrade existing infrastructure (Astro-Nodes, Core Nexus, Grid Services).  
7. **Respond to Events:** React to "Cosmic Volatility Events" (e.g., Astro-Node failures, Astro-Unit crashes, network issues) by reconfiguring directives, isolating problematic Astro-Nodes, or applying researched solutions.

## **7\. Player Roles & Goals**

The player embodies the role of an **Interstellar Grid Administrator**.  
**Primary Goals:**

* Maximize Credit generation through efficient resource extraction and trade.  
* Expand the Galactic Grid by acquiring and optimizing new Astro-Nodes.  
* Build the most resilient and self-healing grid.  
* Unlock all advanced Grid Technologies.  
* Achieve a high "Grid Efficiency Rating" (game's score/leaderboard metric).

## **8\. Key Mechanics (Galactic Grid Abstractions)**

### **8.1. Astro-Nodes (Game Areas)**

* **Representation:** Each Astro-Node is a distinct, visible game area (e.g., a floating asteroid, a moonlet).  
* **Unique Features:**  
  * **Resource Type:** Each Astro-Node specializes in producing a unique raw resource (e.g., "Compute Shards," "Memory Glyphs").  
  * **Environmental Challenges:** Astro-Nodes have inherent stability or environmental factors that affect Astro-Unit performance or introduce "Cosmic Volatility Events" (e.g., "High Latency Node," "Unstable Core Node," "Resource-Scarce Node").  
  * **Capacity:** Each Astro-Node has a finite "resource capacity" (CPU, Memory, Storage) limiting the number of Astro-Units it can efficiently host.  
* **Actions:**  
  * **Provisioning:** Players purchase new Astro-Nodes using Credits, expanding their operational footprint.  
  * **Upgrading:** Improve an Astro-Node's capacity or stability.  
  * **Isolate/Relocate Command:** Temporarily or permanently remove an Astro-Node from active Astro-Unit scheduling for maintenance or decommissioning (Astro-Units are migrated off).

### **8.2. Astro-Units (Units)**

* **Representation:** Small, customizable, autonomous units that perform tasks on Astro-Nodes.  
* **Astro-Unit Types ("Images"):** Players unlock different "Astro-Unit Images" through the technology tree.  
  * **Miner Units:** Primary raw resource extractors. Different Miner Units for different raw resources.  
  * **Processor Units:** Convert raw resources into refined (higher-value) goods. Require specific raw materials.  
  * **Security Units:** Automatically defend Astro-Nodes against "Cosmic Volatility Events" or mitigate their effects.  
  * **Telemetry Units:** Collects detailed real-time performance data and diagnostic information from Astro-Nodes and other Astro-Units. Deploying these units reveals deeper insights on the Galactic Grid Overview.  
  * **Relay Units:** Facilitate direct, efficient data and resource transfer between other Astro-Units and Astro-Nodes, bypassing the Central Repository for specific workflows.  
  * **Fabricator Units:** Consumes refined resources to produce "Upgrade Modules" or "Expansion Components" for Astro-Nodes or the Galactic Grid itself.  
  * **Explorer Units:** Sent to scout unexplored sectors of the cosmos to discover new Astro-Nodes (a pre-requisite for provisioning new Nodes).  
  * **Guard Units:** Automatically deploy one instance per Astro-Node to provide constant, low-level protection or a passive resource-gathering boost across the entire grid.  
  * **Recycling Units:** Breaks down failed or decommissioned Astro-Units/resources for a partial Credit refund or raw material recovery.  
* **Resource Demands & Constraints:** Each Astro-Unit type requires specific "Processing Power" and "Memory Allocation" "Demands" from the Astro-Node. Players can set "Constraints" to prevent runaway resource consumption. Exceeding these constraints can lead to "Resource Overload," causing reduced output, temporary production halts, or even cascading failures if not addressed promptly. Astro-Units might enter a 'Throttled' state, severely limiting their efficiency until resources are freed up.  
* **Operational Scanners & Readiness Checks:** Astro-Units have automated health checks. If an Astro-Unit fails its checks, it is automatically "Restarted." However, each restart incurs a penalty, such as a temporary reduction in output, a short downtime for the Astro-Unit, or a small resource cost for regeneration. Repeated failures could lead to a 'Degraded' status, requiring manual intervention or specialized repair units to fully restore. This demonstrates the grid's self-healing capabilities.  
* **Proximity Directives:** Advanced technology allowing players to specify preferences for Astro-Unit placement (e.g., "place this Processor Unit near a Miner Unit," or "distribute these two critical Astro-Units across different Astro-Nodes").

### **8.3. Resources & Economy**

* **Raw Resources:** Unique to specific Astro-Nodes (e.g., "Compute Shards," "Memory Glyphs").  
* **Processed Resources:** Higher-value goods created by Processor Units (e.g., "Optimized Compute Units," "Encrypted Data Packets," "Resilient Frameworks").  
* **Credits:** The primary currency, earned by selling resources.  
* **Dynamic Market:** Resource prices fluctuate based on player's supply, simulated galactic demand, and special events. Timing sales is crucial.

### **8.4. Directives & Replicator Matrices**

* **Declarative Management:** Players interact with the system by defining a *desired state*. For example, instead of clicking to spawn 5 Astro-Units, they create a "Directive" that *declarates* "I want 5 Miner Units running on Astro-Node Alpha."  
* **Replicator Matrices:** Automatically created by Directives, ensuring the desired number of Astro-Unit instances are running. If an Astro-Unit crashes, the Replicator Matrix ensures a new one is launched.  
* **Player Interaction:** Players adjust desired replica counts, update Astro-Unit Images (upgrade them), or redeploy to new Astro-Nodes.

### **8.5. Scaling**

* **Adaptive Scaling Protocol (HPA equivalent):** An unlockable technology. Once active, players can configure Adaptive Scaling rules (e.g., "if Astro-Node Alpha's Processing Power utilization exceeds 80%, automatically increase Miner Units by 2"). This automates scaling based on metrics gathered by Telemetry Units.  
* **Grid Expansion Engine (Cluster Autoscaler equivalent):** A late-game technology. When Astro-Node capacity is exhausted or current Astro-Nodes are heavily stressed, this system automatically provisions and adds new Astro-Nodes to the Galactic Grid.

### **8.6. Technology Tree (Grid Tech)**

A branching research tree representing advancements in Galactic Grid management.

* **Basic Tier:** Unlock basic Astro-Unit types, manual directives.  
* **Intermediate Tier:** Adaptive Scaling Protocol, new Processor Unit types, basic Security Units, Astro-Node Upgrades, **Telemetry Unit deployment**.  
* **Advanced Tier:** Grid Expansion Engine, Guard Units, Fabricator Units, **Interlink Network (Relay Units)** for complex resource routing, more resilient Astro-Node architectures, **Insight Modules (for Dashboards)**.  
* **Experimental Tier:** "Transient Burst Modules" (event-driven, short-burst Astro-Units), AI-driven optimization algorithms, multi-grid federation. This tier also includes 'Flow Optimizer Units' that passively improve Interlink channel efficiency, and 'Archeologist Units' that find rare, high-value resources on existing Astro-Nodes.

### **8.7. Challenges & Events (Cosmic Volatility Events)**

Random or player-triggered events that test the Galactic Grid's resilience.

* **Astro-Node Failures:** An Astro-Node unexpectedly goes offline (simulated cosmic storm, structural collapse). Astro-Units on that Node become "Unreachable." Players must use Isolate/Relocate Commands and redeploy Astro-Units.  
* **Astro-Unit Crashes:** Individual Astro-Units fail due to internal errors or resource starvation. Replicator Matrices will restart them, but it impacts production.  
* **Network Latency Spikes:** Reduces resource transfer rates from certain Astro-Nodes, impacting collection and processing.  
* **Resource Contention:** A surge in demand for a specific Astro-Node's resources, causing Astro-Units to be "Pending" or experience "Performance Lag."  
* **Security Breaches:** Can temporarily disable Astro-Units or steal resources if not addressed by Security Units or "Flow Control Protocols" (unlockable tech).

Each researched "Grid Technology" (e.g., advanced Security Units, improved Flow Control Protocols) provides specific countermeasures. For instance, 'Graviton Shields' (a tech upgrade) could reduce the impact of 'Cosmic Storms' on Astro-Nodes, or a 'Self-Repair Protocol' (another tech) could allow Astro-Units to autonomously recover from crashes faster without requiring full restarts or manual intervention.

* **Planned Stress Tests:** Players can intentionally trigger minor cosmic volatility events to test the robustness of their grid before major events hit.

### **8.8. Observability (O11y) Integration**

* **Information Veil:** Initially, the Galactic Grid provides only high-level status. Players will see "Astro-Node Alpha is Unhealthy" but not the underlying cause.  
* **Telemetry Units:** Deploying these units onto Astro-Nodes is crucial for gaining deeper "Insight."  
  * **Basic Telemetry:** Reveals general Astro-Node health, overall resource output, and high-level Astro-Unit counts.  
  * **Advanced Telemetry:** Multiple Telemetry Units or upgraded versions provide granular data: individual Astro-Unit throughput, resource consumption, specific error codes, and environmental readings.  
* **Insight Modules (Dashboards):** Researching this technology unlocks the ability to customize the "Galactic Grid Overview" with "Data Displays." Players can drag-and-drop various metrics (e.g., Processing Power utilization, Memory Allocation per Astro-Node, raw resource production rates, Astro-Unit restart counts) from their Telemetry Units to build custom dashboards. This allows them to visualize and understand their grid's performance at a glance.  
* **Anomaly Notifier (Alertmanager equivalent):** An advanced Insight Module. Players can configure "Anomaly Notifiers" to set thresholds for critical metrics. When a threshold is breached (e.g., Astro-Node stability drops below 20%, Processor Unit output falls by 50%), the Anomaly Notifier triggers a visual and/or audio alert, directing the player's attention to the problem area without constant manual inspection. This makes the invisible visible.

### **8.9. Service Discovery Integration (New Section)**

* **Centralized Dispatch (Initial State):** By default, Miner Units deposit raw resources into the Astro-Node's local buffer, which is then transported to the Central Repository. Processor Units, wherever they are, pull raw resources from this Central Repository. This works but introduces latency and overhead.  
* **Interlink Network (Service Mesh equivalent):** Unlocked via the technology tree, this allows for direct, optimized communication between Astro-Units and Astro-Nodes. Players deploy **Relay Units** to establish this network.  
  * **Local Interlinks:** A Relay Unit deployed on an Astro-Node can "interlink" Miner Units directly to Processor Units on the *same* Astro-Node. This enables direct, low-latency transfer of raw materials for immediate processing, significantly boosting local efficiency.  
  * **Cross-Node Interlinks:** Advanced Relay Units (higher tech tier) can establish dedicated "Interlink Channels" between specific Astro-Nodes. This allows Processor Units on one Astro-Node to directly request and receive raw materials from Miner Units on a *different* Astro-Node, bypassing the Central Repository and enabling highly optimized, distributed processing workflows. This is the core "service discovery" mechanism. Players actively manage and prioritize these Interlink Channels via a dedicated 'Interlink Routing Console.' They can define "Routing Policies" to control which Astro-Units connect to which resource providers, create redundant paths, or even temporarily 'deactivate' specific channels to reroute traffic during cosmic events. This offers strategic depth in optimizing resource flow.  
* **Flow Control Protocols (Network Policy equivalent):** As part of the Interlink Network, players can research and implement "Flow Control Protocols." These allow players to prioritize certain types of resource or data flow, or to "quarantine" (isolate) problematic Interlink Channels or Astro-Units to prevent cascading failures.  
* **Traffic Distributors (Load Balancer equivalent):** Advanced Interlink Network upgrades can include "Traffic Distributors." These automatically balance the requests for resources or processing power across multiple available Processor Units or Astro-Nodes, ensuring optimal utilization and preventing single points of congestion.

## **9\. Art Style & User Interface**

* **Art Style:** Clean, geometric, low-poly with soft, glowing elements for resources and data flow. Astro-Nodes could resemble miniature planets or geometric asteroids. Astro-Units are simple, customizable block-like drones with expressive icons.  
* **Color Palette:** Vibrant and functional. Greens for healthy, efficient systems; yellows for warnings; reds for critical failures. Transparent overlays for data visualization.  
* **User Interface (UI):** Inspired by sci-fi control panels and system dashboards.  
  * **Galactic Grid Overview:** A central screen showing overall grid health, animated resource graphs (Processing Power, Memory Utilization across Astro-Nodes), active Directives, and real-time event logs. Customizable Data Displays (from Insight Modules) will appear here.  
  * **Astro-Node View:** Clicking on an Astro-Node provides a detailed view of its current Astro-Units, resource consumption, specific environmental factors, and local telemetry data.  
  * **Directive Editor:** A clear interface to define new Directives or modify existing ones (e.g., adjust replica count, select Astro-Unit Image, assign to Astro-Node).  
  * **Technology Tree:** A visual graph of unlockable technologies.  
  * **Marketplace:** Simple interface to buy/sell resources with price trends.  
  * **Insight Systems (O11y UI):** A dedicated tab or section to configure Telemetry Units, design Data Displays, and set up Anomaly Notifiers.  
* **Animations:** Smooth transitions for Astro-Unit deployments, resource flow, and UI updates. Visual feedback for Astro-Unit health (e.g., green glow, blinking red if failing). Animated data flow lines for the Interlink Network.

## **10\. Sound & Music**

* **Music:** Ambient, evolving electronic soundtrack that shifts subtly with the grid's state (e.g., calm and flowing when healthy, slightly more tense during cosmic volatility events).  
* **Sound Effects:** Satisfying clicks and beeps for UI interactions. Distinctive sounds for Astro-Unit deployment, resource collection, data transfer, and critical alerts (e.g., a soft hum for healthy Astro-Nodes, a jarring static for a failing Astro-Node, a distinct chime for an Anomaly Notifier alert).

## **11\. Target Audience**

* Casual and mid-core gamers who enjoy simulation, resource management, and base-building games.  
* Individuals with a nascent or casual interest in technology, DevOps, or distributed systems, offering a playful introduction to abstract concepts.  
* Game jam participants looking for a technically interesting yet playable concept.

## **12\. Platform**

* Initially designed for **Web (HTML5, JavaScript)** for accessibility during a game jam.  
* Potentially expandable to PC desktop platforms.
